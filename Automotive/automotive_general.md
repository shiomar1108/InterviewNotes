# Automotive Interview Notes:


## ASPICE:
- `Automotive Software Process Improvement Capability dEtermination.`
- Adaptation of ISO33061 -> No tools but determine the completition and achievement of each process.
- V Model.
- Focused on intended outcomes, not on the process.
- Goals:
  - Traceability.
  - Reliability and Quality.
### Process groups:
- SWE.1 - Software Requirements Analysis .
- SWE.2 - Software Architectural Design.
- SWE.3 - Software Detailed Design and Unit Construction.
- SWE.4 - Software Unit Verification.
- SWE.5 - Software Integration and Integration Test.
- SWE.6 - Software Qualification Test .
### ASPICE Levels:
- Level 0: (Basic/Incomplete).
  - Somewhat meet ASPICE requirements. 
- Level 1: (Performed).
  - Almost or entirely achieve ASPICE requirements, but may have components missing in the process. 
- Level 2: (Managed).
  - Deliver the work products reliably and almost or entirely achieve ASPICE standards in addition to the work products. 
- Level 3: (Established).
  - Established and set the performance standards for the organization and continuously monitor them for improvements. 
- Level 4: (Predictable).
  - Beyond having established performance standards, analyze outcomes and produce predictable results. 
- Level 5: (Innovating).
  - Process is consistent, predictable, and continuously improved. 


## Functional Safety:
- ISO 26262.
- Concept, development, production, operation, services and de-comissioning.
- Risk based.

- HARA -> Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment.
- Method of fault tolerance, diagnostic coverage.
- Validation and Verification process -> Testing and analysis.
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Structured framework for the development of Safety Critical Systems.
- 
#### Severity:
- S0:
  - No injuries.
- S1:
  - Light or moderate injuries.
- S2:

#### Exposure:
- E0:
  - Incredible Unlikely
- E1:
  - Very Low.
- E2:
  - Low.
- E3:
  - Medium.
- E4:
  - High.
#### Controllability:
- C0:
  - Cotrollable in general.
- C1:
  - Simply controllable.
- C2:
  - Normally Controllable.
- C3:
  - Diffucult-to-uncontrollable.
### ASIL Levels:
- ASILs -> Automotive Safety Integrity Levels.
- ASIL D:
- ASIL C:
- ASIL B:
- ASIL A:
- ASIL QM:
  - No safety relevance.
