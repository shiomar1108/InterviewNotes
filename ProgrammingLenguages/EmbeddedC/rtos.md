# RTOS Interview Notes:
- Logical correctness of the operation within a deterministic deadlines.
- Can support this real-time functioning.

## Priority Inversion:
- Happend when a low-priority task pre-empted a high-priority task.
- When a High-priority task have to wait until a low-priority task finish excecution.

## Benefits of RTOS:
- Ability to schedule task.
- Multitasking (pseudo).
- Deterministic behavior.

## Interprocess Communications (IPC):
- Provides a mechanism to exachange data and information across multiple processes.
### Pipes
- 
### Named Pipes (FIFO):
- 
### Semaphores:
- Variable that control the access to a resource.
- Binary semaphore -> 1/0.
- Couting semaphore -> deals with a large set of values.
### Mutex:
- 
### Shared Memory
- 
### Message Queue:
- 
### Socket:
-
